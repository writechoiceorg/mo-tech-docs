        while the principal repayment remains the same. This approach offers borrowers a transparent and simple
        repayment schedule, which is ideal for those who prefer stable repayment amounts. With each installment, the
        outstanding principal amount is reduced, leading to a gradual decrease in the overall interest paid over time.
